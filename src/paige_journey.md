# Paige's Evolving Intimacy Framework

## Systems Development
- **Biofeedback Integration**  
  Heart rate monitor linked to spreadsheet tracking BPM spikes correlated with specific touch stimuli  
  *Hypothesis: "72% efficacy in left earlobe stimulation suggests erectile tissue adjacency"*

- **Environmental Optimization**  
  - Blue LED lighting (470nm wavelength mimicking mesopelagic mating grounds)  
  - White noise generator playing humpback whale songs (72 dB SPL)

## Cognitive Metrics
`Vulnerability Index` scoring system:
1. Syllogism reliance during kissing (-15pts)
2. Unplanned eye contact duration (+0.5pts/sec)
3. Protocol deviation penalty (-20pts)

## Communication Protocols
**Metaphorical Framework:**  
"Your laugh patterns suggest coral spawning events - soft, overwhelming, life-generating. Recommend increased frequency."

**Conflict Resolution:**  
Pelagic Peace Accord ยง4.1:  
"Aphotic zone silences >7 minutes require bioluminescent confirmation pulses (smartwatch LED x3)"

## Interdependency Models

## Empirical Findings
```python
def calculate_kissing_efficiency(unplanned=True):
    if unplanned:
        return bpm_delta * 1.32  # See Appendix C (6/14 dataset)
    else:
        return bpm_delta * 0.88
```

## Conclusion
*"All models fail at 23:47 when your eyelash lands on my spectrometer. Hypothesis revised: Love's nonlinearity requires lifetime longitudinal study."*
